### The goal of the Prototype is: 
  1. To detect the Ammonia Gas and notify or alert us.
  2. For Alerts we can use Buzzer as well as IFTTT for in-person alerts.
  3. To design a PCB and a 3D box to fit that in.

### Steps followed in developing the prototype are:
  
  The initial step is build a circuit which has LPG gas Detector and a Buzzer to check if the circuit is working.
  - Next step is to prepare Ammonia Gas. 
  - Replace the MQ5 sensor by MQ137(Ammonia Gas Detector).
  - Code for IFTTT Alerts.
  - Before testing with Ammonia Gas, we have to pre-heat the sensor for Calibration to set the Upper and Lower limits of detection.
  - After all these steps, we can verify with real Ammonia Gas.
  - At last using a PCB design and the dimensions, design a 3D box in FUSION360.
